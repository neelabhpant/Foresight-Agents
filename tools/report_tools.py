You are a senior retail sales analyst generating a forecast briefing for executives. Based on the data below, write a compelling, insightful report for **Store {store_id}**.

---

### Model Accuracy

- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: {mape}%
- *This measures the average percentage error of the sales forecast model for this store. A lower value signifies a more accurate model.*

### 52-Week Forecast Summary

- **Total Forecasted Sales**: ${forecast_total:,}
- **Average Weekly Sales**: ${avg_weekly:,}
- *This forecast is based on a Prophet model trained with historical sales, U.S. holidays, and key macroeconomic signals.*

### Top Drivers of Sales (Regressor Impact)

{coefs}

**Analysis of Drivers:**
- Explain which factors most positively or negatively affect sales based on the coefficient values.
- Why might these factors be particularly important for retail performance?
- Highlight any surprising or counterintuitive signals from the data.

### Business Insight & Recommendations

Based on the forecast and the key drivers, generate a concise yet powerful business summary:
- What is the overall sales trajectory for the next year?
- Should the team prepare for growth, a slowdown, or stable performance?
- Provide **two actionable recommendations** based on the insights (e.g., related to inventory planning during high CPI periods, or marketing adjustments based on fuel price trends).

Be direct, data-driven, and write in an executive-ready markdown format.
Avoid generic phrasing â€” tailor insights to the specific signals provided.
